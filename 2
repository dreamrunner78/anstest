Yes, Apache NiFi supports the ingestion and handling of encrypted data, but it does not perform encryption or decryption automatically unless you configure it to do so explicitly using processors.
üîê Where encryption/decryption happens in NiFi:
1. During Data Ingestion (Input)

NiFi can ingest encrypted data from external sources (e.g., S3, Kafka, HTTPS, etc.), but:

    You must use a processor to decrypt it if needed (e.g., DecryptContent, custom script, or invoke an external service).

    NiFi does not automatically decrypt incoming data.

2. During Data Routing/Processing

You can use:

    EncryptContent and DecryptContent processors for AES, PGP, etc.

    ExecuteScript or InvokeScriptedProcessor to handle custom encryption/decryption logic.

    External services via InvokeHTTP or InvokeAWSLambda to offload the encryption/decryption process.

3. At Rest (on disk)

    NiFi‚Äôs content repository, provenance repository, and flowfile repository can be protected using disk-level encryption (outside of NiFi) or encryption at rest features from your storage system (like EBS encrypted volumes in AWS).

    NiFi itself does not encrypt flow files on disk unless you've configured encryption at the processor level.

4. During Transmission

    NiFi supports TLS/SSL for secure data transmission between:

        NiFi nodes (cluster)

        NiFi and external systems (e.g., HTTPS, Secure Site-to-Site, Kafka with SSL)

        NiFi Registry
