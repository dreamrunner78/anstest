To dynamically manage configuration files without restarting NiFi pods, you can:

    Create a shared volume with ReadWriteMany (RWX) access (e.g., NFS, CephFS, or PVC backed by RWX storage).

    Mount this volume in both:

        The NiFi pods (as read-only or read-write depending on your needs).

        Ephemeral pods (dedicated to managing configuration, with read-write access).

    Load ConfigMaps into the ephemeral pods, then write their contents into the shared RWX volume.

    The NiFi pods will then read the configuration from the shared volume, allowing updates without restarting the pods.

This approach decouples ConfigMap updates from NiFi restarts, enabling more flexible and dynamic configuration management.
