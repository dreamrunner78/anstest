Proposed Deployment Mechanism for NiFi Pipelines Across Environments (DEV, QA, PROD):

The idea is to leverage NiFi Registry for version-controlling NiFi dataflows. A Kubernetes job will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to automate the promotion of pipelines between environments (e.g., from DEV to QA to PROD).

This Kubernetes job will:

    Use the NiFi CLI (nifi-toolkit) to interact with NiFi and NiFi Registry.

    Authenticate with NiFi using mutual TLS (mTLS) to ensure secure communication.

    Fetch and deploy pipelines by exporting/importing versioned flows.

    Accept a comprehensive set of parameters (e.g., flow name, version, target environment, variable overrides) to provide flexibility and ease of use.

This approach enables consistent, secure, and automated deployment of NiFi pipelines across multiple environments, reducing manual errors and improving delivery speed.
