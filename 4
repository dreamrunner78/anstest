    Processor: GetSFTP, ListSFTP, FetchSFTP

    Supports: Public/private key auth, passwords, custom ports

    ✅ Automates polling, listing, fetching

    🔐 Secure channel: SSH or TLS

2. HTTPS

    Processor: InvokeHTTP, ListenHTTP, HandleHttpRequest

    Supports: HTTPS with client and server certs, tokens, headers

    ✅ Automates receiving or pulling data from REST APIs securely

3. Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage / Azure Blob Storage

    Processors: FetchS3Object, ListS3, GetS3Object, etc.

    ✅ Secure via IAM roles, access keys, or service principals

    🔐 TLS secured APIs

4. Kafka with SSL

    Processor: ConsumeKafka, PublishKafka

    ✅ Full support for SSL/TLS encryption and authentication

    🔐 Ideal for real-time secure streams

5. WebDAV, SCP, HDFS (Kerberos-secured)

    ✅ Works with additional secure protocols used in enterprise settings

🔁 Example Use Case

Automated SFTP Ingestion:

    ListSFTP: Lists new files from a secure SFTP server

    FetchSFTP: Downloads them

    PutFile or PutS3Object: Saves them locally or to cloud storage

    Scheduled with cron-like intervals or event-driven triggers
